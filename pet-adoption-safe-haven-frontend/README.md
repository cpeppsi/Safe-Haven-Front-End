# Pet Adoption: Safe Haven

## This is the second milestone project for NCSU software development program by Casey, Evan, Ligia, and Mayna.

### This is a fullstack MERN application which allows user of "Safe Haven Shelter" to CREATE new adoption listings for both cats and dogs, READ the adoption listings, UPDATE the adoption listings, and DELETE them. It also allows users to explore the website with a navbar and view an About page with Safe Haven Shelter's Mission.
